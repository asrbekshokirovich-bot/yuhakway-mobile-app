# Signup Issue - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem
Users getting stuck on "Yuklanmoqda..." (Loading) when trying to sign up, and accounts are not being created.

## Root Cause
The most common cause is **email confirmation being enabled in Supabase**, which prevents immediate login after signup.

## Solution: Disable Email Confirmation in Supabase

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your Yuhakway project

2. **Navigate to Authentication Settings**
   - Click on "Authentication" in the left sidebar
   - Click on "Providers"
   - Click on "Email"

3. **Disable Email Confirmation**
   - Find the toggle for "Confirm email"
   - Turn it **OFF** (disable it)
   - Click "Save" at the bottom

4. **Restart the Mobile App**
   - The changes should take effect immediately
   - Try signing up again

## What This Fix Does

When email confirmation is disabled:
- ✅ Users can sign up and login immediately
- ✅ No email verification required
- ✅ Faster onboarding experience
- ✅ Better for testing and development

When email confirmation is enabled:
- ❌ Users must verify email before login
- ❌ Signup process gets stuck if not handled properly
- ❌ Requires email server configuration
- ❌ More complex user flow

## Alternative: Handle Email Confirmation Properly

If you WANT to keep email confirmation enabled, you need to:

1. **Update the signup flow** to show a message:
   ```
   "Account created! Please check your email to verify your account."
   ```

2. **Add email verification handling** in the app
   - Show verification pending state
   - Handle email verification links
   - Allow users to resend verification emails

3. **Configure email templates** in Supabase
   - Customize verification email
   - Set up proper email delivery

## Current Implementation

The app now has:
- ✅ 30-second timeout protection
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
- ✅ Auto-login attempt after signup
- ✅ Proper error handling

## Testing the Fix

After disabling email confirmation:

1. Clear app data/cache (optional)
2. Try signing up with a new email
3. You should be logged in immediately
4. Dashboard should appear within 2-3 seconds

## Debug Information

If issues persist, check the browser/Expo console for:
- "Signup response:" - Shows Supabase response
- "Session created immediately" - Confirms auto-login worked
- "User created, but confirmation may be required" - Email confirmation detected
- Any error messages

## Still Having Issues?

Check these common problems:

1. **Internet Connection**
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Supabase requires network access

2. **Supabase Project Status**
   - Verify project is not paused
   - Check if you have sufficient quota

3. **Email Already Registered**
   - Try with a different email
   - Check if account already exists

4. **Password Requirements**
   - Minimum 6 characters
   - Try a stronger password

5. **Invalid Email Format**
   - Use proper email format: user@domain.com
   - Avoid special characters

## Contact Support

If none of the above works:
1. Check Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. See if user was created but not confirmed
3. Check Supabase logs for error messages
4. Contact Supabase support if needed
