### 2. ✅ Account Credential Sync
- **Status:** READY (Requires CRM update)
- Mobile app configured to accept Supabase Auth credentials
- When CRM creates student → Supabase Auth user created
- Random password generated by CRM stored in Supabase
- Student can login to mobile app with those credentials
- **Action Required:** Implement password generation in CRM (see CRM_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)

### 3. ✅ Password Change Sync
- **Status:** WORKING
- Mobile app has dedicated "Change Password" screen
- Uses Supabase Auth `updateUser()` API
- Password updated directly in Supabase Auth
- New password instantly valid for both CRM and mobile app
- No separate databases = instant sync

### 4. ✅ Supabase Auth Only (No Self-Signup)
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- Mobile app has NO signup screen
- Only login, logout, and change password

- **Messages:** Supabase tables (when implemented)
- **Calendar data:** `calendar_events` table in Supabase
- **Documents:** `documents` table in Supabase
- Mobile app reads/writes directly from these tables

### 7. ✅ RLS Policies Intact
- **Status:** PRESERVED
