<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully initiated the Yuhakway mobile app development from a web CRM blueprint. Key steps included establishing the Expo/React Native project, integrating Supabase for authentication and data, and implementing core student dashboard features (login, applications, calendar, profile). The UI/UX was significantly refined based on detailed user feedback, incorporating a modern, Korean-inspired aesthetic and Yuhakway branding. The authentication flow was adjusted from self-signup to a CRM-managed, login-only approach, necessitating CRM modifications. Persistent GitHub cloning issues prevented direct CRM modifications, so the AI engineer provided patch files and guides for the user to apply to their web CRM. Critical bugs in the CRM (duplicate payments, finance section access for admins) were also addressed with generated SQL and code fixes. The most recent issue involves a conflict between the mobile app and web CRM project structures on GitHub, leading to Lovable's inability to push changes even after deleting the mobile app's directory from the web CRM's repository.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a fully functional mobile app (Android + iOS) called Yuhakway for students, mirroring the logic, structure, and data flow of the existing Yuhakway web platform's Student Dashboard.

**Functional Requirements:**
*   **Authentication:** Students log in/out (initially email/password with self-signup, then changed to CRM-managed accounts with random passwords provided by admins, no self-signup, with password change functionality).
*   **Student Dashboard:** Home screen with overview, quick access to application progress and messages.
*   **Applications:** View and manage university applications (list, detail cards with status, documents, notes).
*   **Documents:** View uploaded documents, upload new ones.
*   **Messages:** Chat-like interface.
*   **Calendar:** Track application stages and events.
*   **Notifications:** For updates and messages.
*   **Profile:** View personal information, edit details, change password.
*   **Localization:** Support for Uzbek (main), Russian, English, Korean.
*   **Theme:** Dark/Light mode toggle.

**Design Requirements:**
*   **Consistency:** Use the same colors, fonts, and visual styles as the web version, maintaining a modern, clean, academic, minimalistic, professional, and trust-based brand.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** Korean-inspired design with soft gradients, rounded shapes, elegant spacing, smooth shadows. Prioritize clarity, confidence, simplicity, thumb-friendliness, gesture-driven interfaces. Apple + Korean EdTech aesthetic.
*   **Branding:** Use the official Yuhakway logo.
*   **Navigation:** Bottom navigation bar (Home, Applications, Messages, Calendar, Profile).
*   **Micro-interactions:** Smooth animations for transitions, progress bars, hover/press effects, loading indicators.

**Technical Requirements:**
*   **Backend Integration:** Same backend logic (API endpoints, Supabase authentication).
*   **Database:** Connect to the existing Supabase project, not a new one. Supabase is the single source of truth for all data.
*   **Role-based visibility:** Student-only access.
*   **Optimization:** For both iOS and Android.
*   **Scalability:** Structured for future modules (admin/staff apps).

**CRM Integration Requirements (Post-initial Mobile App Build):**
*   **Student Account Management:** When a new student is created in the CRM, their credentials (login + random password) must automatically sync with Supabase Auth, and the password should be visible in the CRM student card.
*   **Password Change Sync:** Mobile app password changes must update in Supabase and be valid for the CRM.
*   **Admin Access Control:** Admin role should have full access to the Finance section in the CRM.
*   **Bug Fix:** Address duplicate payment creation in CRM's payment section.

**Project Separation:** The mobile app (Emergent/GitHub) and web CRM (Lovable/GitHub) must be separated into distinct repositories to avoid conflicts.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is structured as a monorepo with separate  (FastAPI) and  (Expo/React Native) directories, plus an existing web CRM which is external to this workspace but uses the same Supabase.

**Directory Structure (Simplified for Mobile App):**


**Key Files and Modifications:**

*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Initializes the Supabase client.
    *   **Changes**: Configured with the provided Supabase URL and public API key.  and  are set for mobile-specific auth handling.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Manages user authentication state (login, signup, logout, session management) with Supabase.
    *   **Changes**: Modified to remove email confirmation logic for  and . It now handles immediate session setting post-signup.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: User login interface.
    *   **Changes**: Redesigned for modern UI/UX, removed the signup link, added a Forgot Password link, and integrated the Yuhakway logo.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: User registration interface.
    *   **Changes**: Redesigned for modern UI/UX, integrated the Yuhakway logo. Functionality was later modified to remove email verification and handle immediate login. This screen is now effectively removed from the user flow.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Displays student profile information.
    *   **Changes**: Added a Change Password option.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Screen for students to change their password.
    *   **Changes**: New file created to implement password change functionality via Supabase.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Expo configuration file (app name, icon, splash screen, environment variables).
    *   **Changes**: Updated with  app name and potentially other configuration relevant to the UI/UX redesign.
*   **CRM-related patches (e.g., , , , )**:
    *   **Importance**: These are external files generated by the AI engineer for the *user to apply to their web CRM project*. They contain SQL for database schema changes, Supabase Edge Function code, and UI code patches for the web CRM's  and .
    *   **Changes**:
        *   SQL to add , ,  columns to the  table.
        *   Edge function to generate and update random passwords for students.
        *   Patch to  to display student login credentials (email, password, generate password button).
        *   SQL and  changes to enable admin access to the finance section and fix duplicate payment issues.

The  directory with  and  is part of the initial template but has not been significantly altered or used for the mobile app's primary Supabase-driven features.

<pending_tasks>
-   Applying the CRM modification patches and SQL scripts to the actual Yuhakway web CRM by the user (login credentials section, duplicate payment fix, admin finance access fix).
-   Resolving the underlying GitHub push issue from Lovable after deleting the  directory (external to this workspace).
-   Further UI/UX redesign for remaining screens (e.g., Onboarding, Student Dashboard, Messages, Documents, Calendar, Profile details).
-   Implementing Google login integration as per UI/UX requirements.
-   Full multi-language support beyond Uzbek (Russian, English, Korean).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical environmental/project structure issue reported by the user. The user stated that Lovable (their web CRM platform) was unable to push changes to GitHub because the repository had a mixed structure â€” both the React Native/Expo mobile app (in ) and the web React project at the root level.

The AI engineer identified this as a conflict preventing proper building and syncing. The proposed solution was to separate the projects, specifically by deleting the  directory (containing the mobile app) from the web CRM's GitHub repository. The user then reported that Lovable successfully deleted the  directory, but the issue of *not being able to publish/push to GitHub persisted*.

Therefore, the current work is to **troubleshoot and resolve why Lovable is still unable to push changes to GitHub, even after the conflicting  directory (containing the mobile app's code) has been removed from the web CRM's repository.** This is an external issue related to the web CRM's deployment environment.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Troubleshoot the persistent GitHub push failure from Lovable, focusing on the web CRM's configuration or Lovable's integration.
